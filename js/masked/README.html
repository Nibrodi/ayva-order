<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This is a masked input plugin for the jQuery javascript library. It allows a user to more easily enter fixed width input where you would like them to enter the data in a certain format (dates,phone numbers, etc). It has been tested on Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Chrome.  A mask is defined by a format made up of mask literals and mask definitions. Any character not in the definitions list below is considered a mask literal. Mask literals will be automatically entered for the user as they type and will not be able to be removed by the user.The following mask definitions are predefined:</p>
<ul>
<li>a - Represents an alpha character (A-Z,a-z)</li>
<li>9 - Represents a numeric character (0-9)</li>
<li>* - Represents an alphanumeric character (A-Z,a-z,0-9)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your requirements aren&#39;t met by the predefined placeholders, you can always add your own. For example, maybe you need a mask to only allow hexadecimal characters. You can add your own definition for a placeholder, say &#39;h&#39;, like so: <code>$.mask.definitions[&#39;h&#39;] = &quot;[A-Fa-f0-9]&quot;;</code> Then you can use that to mask for something like css colors in hex with a mask &quot;#hhhhhh&quot;.</p>
<p>By design, this plugin will reject input which doesn&#39;t complete the mask. You can bypass this by using a &#39;?&#39; character at the position where you would like to consider input optional. For example, a mask of &quot;(999) 999-9999? x99999&quot; would require only the first 10 digits of a phone number with extension being optional.</p>
